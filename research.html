            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>
                We chose this topic because we believe that many people's mental health is being negatively affected by the extensive use of social media from an early age.
            </p>
            <p>
                Researchers observed a sharp increase in social media usage among young people during the 2020 pandemic. This trend raises concerns about its impact on mental health.
